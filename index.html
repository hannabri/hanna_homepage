                <p><br>Hi, my name is Hanna.<br>
                I am a Data Scientist with great knowledge in NLP and GenAI that I acquired during my NLP masters
                and my internships. The courses covered traditional NLP as well as more recent developments.
                I worked with LLMs both in local through ollama and with the OpenAI and Mistral API. In my end-of-study internship
                I built a simple Re-Act Agent with LangGraph.</p>
                <p>I would describe myself as open-minded and curious to always learn new things. I am also a creative person when it comes 
                to problem sovling. An advantage in programming where things are never working out as they should the first time.
                My adaptability and quick understanding have been most appreciated during my former work experiences.</p>

                </ul>
                For word completion, we used a trie structure as it allows to store letters that compose words. 
                This makes it easier to extract <br>the list of suggestions at each character written by the user.
                The suggestions are based on probabilities calculated over a French SMS corpus. <br>

                We also tested a seeded clustering approach where the centroids were initiated with up to 5 examples. The training data<br>
                was taken from a French verb dataset which includes around 50 examples per verb.<br>
                In our project, the seeded clustering worked best of all tested methods.<br>

                When used with another language, the models performance decreases drastically. Only the Czech model used with German performs well <br>
                with more than 75 % accuracy and vice versa, the model trained on German und used with Czech achieves around 60 % accuracy. <br>
