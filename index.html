                <p><br>Hi, my name is Hanna.<br>
                I am a Data Scientist with great knowledge in NLP and GenAI that I acquired during my NLP masters
                and my internships. The courses covered traditional NLP as well as more recent developments.
                I worked with LLMs both in local through ollama and with the OpenAI and Mistral API. In my end-of-study internship
                I built a simple Re-Act Agent with LangGraph.</p>
                <p>I would describe myself as open-minded and curious to always learn new things. I am also a creative person when it comes 
                to problem sovling. An advantage in programming where things are never working out as they should the first time.
                My adaptability and quick understanding have been most appreciated during my former work experiences.</p>

        <p>
            Six-month internship between January and July 2025 to build a recommandation system for the CPQ tool in 
            ENOVIA's PLM portfolio.The steps followed during the internship were the following:
            <ul class="dassault">
                <li><b>Dynamic Web Scraping</b> to build a test dataset with data from the web.</li>
                <li>Creation of an <b>RDF graph</b> written in Turtle syntax.</li>
                <li>Creation of a <b>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system</b> using a simple Re-Act agent and querying two different data bases:
                <ul>
                    <li>the created RDF graph for structured data and</li>
                    <li>a FAISS vector database for unstructured data.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>SPARQL query generation with a <b>Mistral LLM, a Chain-of-Thought prompt and in-context learning</b> similar to the user question.</li>
                <li>Creation of a simple <b>user interface</b> allowing an easier way to ask questions.</li>
            </ul>
            After completing the RAG system, I worked with an internal Business Intelligence system for data analysis.
